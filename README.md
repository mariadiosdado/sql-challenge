Module 9 Challenge

For this assigment I started using the lecture notes from Lecture 9. Then I used google to find an image that helped me created the code in QuickDBD to sketch the ERD.

To create the tables I used the lecture notes code and modified it to fit the necessary information. In order to write the queries, I used geeksforgeeks.com to learn more about SQL Joins and followed their syntax and examples. For other details like filtering out data starting by a certain letter, I used google. My classmates also help because when someone has questions it gets posted in the groupchat and someone else answers for everyone to see or they post links for resounces and supplementary videos.
